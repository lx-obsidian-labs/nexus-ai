# nexus-ai — Documentation Verification Matrix

**Reviewed:** 2026-11-07  
**Scope:** Next.js/Supabase AI-oriented application  
**Verification status:** Repository structure and package scripts inspected; runtime, CI and deployment not certified by this document.

## Reproducible local baseline

Use a clean checkout and the checked-in npm lockfile. Verify the supported Node version and required environment variable **names** first.

```bash
npm ci
npm run lint
npm run build
```

Product functionality and deployment are not independently verified.

## Acceptance matrix

| Area | Required evidence | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Clean installation | Lockfile-respecting installation on supported Node version | Not executed here |
| Lint / type safety | Command output and dated CI link, if configured | Not verified |
| Build | Successful build output for reviewed SHA | Not verified |
| Key user flows | Browser tests with positive, negative and error cases | Not verified |
| Authorization and privacy | Access-control and data-handling review | Not verified |
| Mobile and accessibility | Keyboard, screen reader and viewport checks | Not verified |
| Deployment | Live URL, deployment ID and production smoke test | Not verified |
| Content and publication | Rights, attribution and owner approval | Not verified |

## Project-specific review

Check Supabase migrations/RLS, AI provider data handling, prompt injection, authentication and rate limiting.
